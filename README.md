## Features
  This plugin allows you to view the recently opened files. It's just like what you have in Intellij, not VSCode offers.

  We encourge you use `cmd` + `e` or `ctrl` + `e` in windows to use this feature. So you might need to update your `keybindings.json` to replace the VSCode's default Open Recent behaviour.

  ```json
  { "key": "cmd+e",                 "command": "extension.openRecentFiles" },
  { "key": "ctrl+e",                 "command": "workbench.action.openRecent" }
  ```

## How to use
  * press `cmd` + `e` (`ctrl` + `e` in Windows)
  * press `F1` then type `Open Recent Files`
